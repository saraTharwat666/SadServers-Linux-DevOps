Scenario: "Tokelau": Delete from history

Level: Medium

Type: Do

Access: Email

Description: Inspired by this nixCraft article.

The objective of this exercise is to delete all the Bash history lines that contain the term foo.

Clearing out or deleting the history file /home/admin/.bash_history is not allowed. Note that in our case, new commands (including the ones to try and delete "foo" from history) are also appended to the history file.

Test: Running history |grep "foo" returns nothing.

The "Check My Solution" button runs the script /home/admin/agent/check.sh, which you can see and execute.

Time to Solve: 15 minutes.
