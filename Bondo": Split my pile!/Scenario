Description: A developer wants to run a program that splits their pile of their data into compressed parts for efficient transport across their network. Unfortunately when the tool runs it never completes.

The application binary in question is called bondo located in /home/admin/bondo.

Run it, then debug and help the developer find the issue.

Test: Executing /home/admin/bondo as admin returns part files generation completed!.

The file /etc/fstab has not been modified and the solution would work on reboot.

The "Check My Solution" button runs the script /home/admin/agent/check.sh, which you can see and execute.

Time to Solve: 20 minutes.
