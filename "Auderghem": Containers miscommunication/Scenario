Scenario: "Auderghem": Containers miscommunication

Level: Medium

Type: Fix

Access: Email

Description: There is an nginx Docker container that listens on port 80, the purpose of which is to redirect the traffic to two other containers statichtml1 and statichtml2 but this redirection is not working.
Fix the problem.

IMPORTANT. You can restart all containers, but don't stop or remove them.

Test: The nginx container must redirect the traffic to the statichtml1 and statichtml2 containers:

curl http://localhost returns the Welcome to nginx default page
curl http://localhost/1 returns HelloWorld;1
curl http://localhost/2 returns HelloWorld;2

The "Check My Solution" button runs the script /home/admin/agent/check.sh, which you can see and execute.
