Scenario: "Alexandria": The Vanishing Backups

Level: Easy

Type: Fix

Access: Email

Description: A critical backup cron job has silently stopped working 3 days ago. The backup script is located at /opt/backup/backup.sh and should create daily backups in /var/backups/daily/, but no new backups have been created recently.

Looking at the backup directory, you can see old backup files from a few days ago, proving the system used to work. However, there are no error emails, no obvious error logs, and the cron service appears to be running normally.

Fix ALL issues preventing the backups from running, so that backups are created successfully and reliably.

Test directory: /var/backups/daily/
Backup script: /opt/backup/backup.sh


Test: The solution will be validated by checking if a backup file has been created in the last 10 minutes.

The "Check My Solution" button runs the script /home/admin/agent/check.sh, which you can see and execute.
